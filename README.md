# MoSAIC
A novel approach to decrease computation cost

MoSAIC: Memory-Optimized Sparse Adaptive Intelligent Computation

Overview:
MoSAIC is a novel neural network prototype designed to mimic certain aspects of the human brain, emphasizing sparse activation, adaptive growth and pruning of neurons, and resource efficiency. The architecture is capable of dynamically adjusting active connections during training to optimize computation and memory usage, making it energy-efficient and CPU-friendly compared to conventional dense networks.

Key Features:

Sparse Activation: Only necessary neurons activate for specific tasks, inspired by human brain functionality.

Adaptive Growth & Pruning: Neural connections grow or prune during training based on performance, preventing memory waste and hallucinations.

Dynamic Memory Handling: Supports temporary and long-term memory allocation for neurons as needed.

Energy Efficiency: Minimizes computational cost while maintaining performance.

Flexible Deployment: Prototype designed to run efficiently on CPU and scalable to cloud environments.

Performance:

Demonstrates significant reduction in FLOPs and active connections without compromising test accuracy.

Experimental results show up to 113× computational efficiency improvement in test scenarios.
